# README linker fragments

- input files (mol2 coordinates and capping group definitions) are located in the folder **in/**
- the linker fragments is adapted from the Amberdyes package (Graen et al. JCTC, 2014) available on Github at github.com/t-/amber-dyes.git
- the mol2 file has the dye removed and capping groups (acetylene and methylene) added using the PyMOL builder. The atom names are adapted to avoid overlap with the nucleobases
- output files generated in the tutorial are saved in *out/*
