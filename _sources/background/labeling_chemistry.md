# Coupling chemistries

The design principles of *FRETlabel* for *in silico* labeling closely follow the building blocks involved when labeling a nucleic acid *in vitro*. *FRETlabel* treats the base, a carbon linker (currently only C6) and the dye moiety as individual fragments to achieve modularity. The PyMOL plugin readily implements various attachement chemistries described in the literature {cite}`Proudnikov.1996, Qin.1999, Zhao.2018`. It comes with a preconfigured set of fluorophores (cyanines, Alexa and Atto dyes). Additional base-linkers fragments and fluorophores can be added by the user. A step-by-step procedure is described in the section [Fragment building](../getting_started/fragment_building.md).

A Cy3 fluorophore covalently attached to a deoxythimidine. The construct is composed of (i) a base, (ii) a linker and (iii) a dye fragment.

## End-labeling

Nucleic acids can be labeled at the 3'- or 5'-ribose via a bridging phosphate. Additionally, insertion of a hydrazide-functionalized dye linker into the 3'-terminal sugar has been described as a way to post-transcriptionally label long RNAs {cite}`Qin.1999, Zhao.2018`.

## Internal labeling

Internal labeling of chemically synthesized RNA and DNA fragments typically use a C5-modified deoxythimidine residue. For long RNAs ethenoadducts can be post-transcriptionally incorporated on adenosine or cytidine residues {cite}`Egloff.2015, Egloff.2016, Zhao.2018`.
